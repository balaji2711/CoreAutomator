The goal of this project is to provide a good starting point for those looking to use SpecFlow, Selenium, Rest sharp and client web socket together. 
It is also intended to demonstrate how to implement design patterns in a functional automation framework, where many test frameworks will violate many different principles like SOLID, 
Static Cling (this one is always the most common), and Explicit Dependencies.
